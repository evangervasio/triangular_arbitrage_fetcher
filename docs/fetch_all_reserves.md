Fetches all the reserves of the triangles listed in a CSV file for a specific swap configuration.

This function retrieves reserve data for each token pair in triangular arbitrage opportunities. It reads from a CSV 
file containing triangular arbitrage data, and concurrently fetches reserve information for each token pair in the 
triangles using multiple threads. The results are then organized and returned in a structured format.

### Detailed Function Workflow:

1. **Determine CSV Path:**
   - Based on the `filter` parameter, the function sets the path to the appropriate CSV file (`trianglesFilter.csv` 
     for filtered results or `triangles.csv` for the complete set).

2. **Initialize Reserve Storage:**
   - An empty dictionary, `reserves`, is initialized to store the reserve data for each triangle.

3. **Read CSV File:**
   - The function opens and reads the CSV file containing the triangle data. It processes each row to fetch reserve 
     data for the tokens listed in the triangle.

4. **Fetch Reserves Concurrently:**
   - Using a thread pool, the function submits tasks to concurrently fetch reserve data for each token pair in the 
     triangles. Each task is associated with the specific row and token pair index.

5. **Collect and Organize Results:**
   - As tasks complete, the function collects the results and organizes them into the `reserves` dictionary. The dictionary 
     keys are row indices, and the values are dictionaries containing reserves for each token pair.

### Parameters:
- `selectedSwap`: An object representing the selected swap configuration, including network and other relevant details.
- `filter`: A boolean flag indicating whether to use a filtered CSV file (`True`) or the complete CSV file (`False`).

### Returns:
- `dict`: A dictionary where each key is a row index from the CSV file, and the value is another dictionary containing 
  the reserves for the token pairs in that row. If a token pair's reserve fetching fails, it is logged but does not disrupt 
  the entire process.
