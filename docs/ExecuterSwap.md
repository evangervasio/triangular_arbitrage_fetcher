The `ExecuterSwapPolygon` function executes a triangular arbitrage transaction on a Polygon network Uniswap fork. 
This function handles all aspects of the transaction, including gas price management, token approval, and the swap 
itself. The actual sending of the transaction is commented out for security reasons.

### Detailed Function Workflow:

1. **Gas Price Check:**
   - The function first checks if the provided gas price (`gwei`) exceeds 500 gwei. If it does, the function 
     halts execution to avoid excessively high transaction costs.

2. **Token Approval (Optional):**
   - If `needToApprove` is `True`, the function will approve the router contract to spend a large amount of the 
     specified token on behalf of the user, doing this will prevent the need of doing multiple approval transactions for smaller amounts each time.
     This process involves:
     - Creating and signing an approval transaction.
     - Sending the signed transaction to the blockchain.
     - Pausing for a minute to ensure the approval transaction is processed.
     - Re-fetching the current gas price to ensure the transaction uses an optimal gas fee.

3. **Gas Price Re-Check:**
   - After approval, the function checks the gas price again. If it exceeds 500 gwei, the function halts to avoid 
     executing the swap with a high gas fee.

4. **Swap Transaction Preparation:**
   - Depending on whether the token has internal fees (`tokenFees` flag), the function prepares the appropriate 
     swap transaction:
     - **With Fees:** Uses `swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens`.
     - **Without Fees:** Uses `swapExactTokensForTokens`.

5. **Transaction Signing:**
   - The function signs the swap transaction with the user's private key.

6. **Transaction Submission:**
   - The code that sends the signed transaction to the blockchain is commented out for security reasons.

### Parameters:
- `selectedSwap`: An object containing relevant swap details, such as the router contract address.
- `amountIn`: The amount of the initial token to be swapped.
- `minAmountOut`: The minimum acceptable amount of the final token after the swap.
- `path`: A list of token addresses representing the swap path (e.g., [TokenA, TokenB, TokenC]).
- `gwei`: The gas price in gwei to be used for the transaction.
- `needToApprove`: A boolean flag indicating whether token approval is required before the swap.
- `tokenFees`: A boolean flag indicating whether the token involves internal transfer fees, requiring the use of 
  a different swap function.

### Returns:
- The function does not return any value but prints execution details.

### Security Notes:
- **Gas Price Management:** The function includes checks to prevent executing transactions with overly high gas fees, 
  protecting the user from excessive costs.
- **Commented Transaction Sending:** The line that actually sends the swap transaction is commented out to prevent 
  accidental execution, which could lead to unintended blockchain interactions.

### Key Features:
- **Flexible Execution:** The function can handle both fee-on-transfer tokens and standard tokens, adapting the swap 
  method accordingly.
- **Automatic Approval Handling:** If required, the function can automatically approve the router contract to spend 
  the user's tokens.
- **Gas Price Monitoring:** The function dynamically monitors and adjusts for gas prices, ensuring the transaction 
  is executed under optimal conditions.
- **Uniswap Fork Compatibility:** The function is highly dynamic and works with every Uniswap fork on the Polygon network,
 making it adaptable to a wide range of decentralized exchanges.

### Potential Risks:
- If the gas price spikes suddenly after the initial check, the transaction may still go through at a higher cost 
  than expected. This is mitigated by a second gas price check after the approval step.
- The function assumes the provided `gwei` and `private_key` are valid and that the user has sufficient funds for gas.
