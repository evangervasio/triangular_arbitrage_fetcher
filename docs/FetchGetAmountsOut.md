Calls the `getAmountOut` function from the Uniswap fork's router smart contract to calculate the output amount 
for a given input amount across a specified token path (triangle).
This function is used to fetch the expected output for a swap transaction in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that are 
forks of Uniswap, such as those on the Polygon and Ethereum networks. The calculation is done by querying the router 
contract of the selected swap.

### Parameters:
- `selectedSwap`: An object representing the selected DEX swap configuration, containing attributes such as `Router` 
  (the address of the router contract) and `Network` (the blockchain network).
- `amountIn`: The input amount for the swap, which will be converted into an integer format.
- `triangle`: A list of token addresses representing the path of the triangular arbitrage.

### Returns:
- `int` or `list`: The output amount(s) resulting from the swap along the specified path. Returns `0` if the contract call fails.
