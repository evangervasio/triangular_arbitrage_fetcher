Returns essential data about a token pair, including the tokens involved, their symbols, and decimal places.

This function retrieves information about a token pair contract on the blockchain. It uses the pair contract's ABI to 
fetch addresses of the two tokens involved and then queries each token's contract for additional details such as their 
decimals and symbols. The function includes retry logic to handle temporary errors and ensure successful data retrieval.

### Parameters:
- `pair`: The address of the pair contract for which data needs to be fetched.

### Returns:
- `tuple`: A tuple containing:
  - The pair address.
  - The address of the first token (`token0`).
  - The address of the second token (`token1`).
  - The decimal places for the first token (`token0_decimals`).
  - The decimal places for the second token (`token1_decimals`).
  - The symbol of the first token (`symbol0`).
  - The symbol of the second token (`symbol1`).

  If any of the values could not be retrieved, they are returned as `None`.
