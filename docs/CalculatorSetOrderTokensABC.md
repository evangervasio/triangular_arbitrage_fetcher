The `CalculatorSetOrderTokensABC` function arranges tokens in a specified order to represent the sequence of trades 
in a triangular arbitrage transaction. In this context, triangular arbitrage involves trading between three different 
tokens in such a way that the trader starts and ends with the same token, ideally generating a profit in the process.

### Detailed Function Workflow:

1. **Identify Token 'A' (Starting and Ending Token):**
   - The function first identifies token 'A', which is the token that the transaction starts and ends with. This token 
     appears both at the first and last positions in the ordered array. The function checks if `triangle[1]` matches 
     either `triangle[4]` or `triangle[5]`:
     - If a match is found, `triangle[1]` is assigned as token 'A'.
     - Otherwise, `triangle[0]` is assigned as token 'A'.

2. **Identify Token 'B' (Intermediate Token 1):**
   - The function then identifies token 'B', which is the second token in the sequence. This token is traded with token 'A'.
     - It checks if `triangle[3]` matches either `triangle[0]` or `triangle[1]`:
     - If a match is found, `triangle[3]` is assigned as token 'B'.
     - Otherwise, `triangle[2]` is assigned as token 'B'.

3. **Identify Token 'C' (Intermediate Token 2):**
   - Finally, the function identifies token 'C', which is the third token in the sequence and is traded with token 'B'. 
     Token 'C' is then traded back to token 'A' to complete the triangle.
     - The function checks if `triangle[5]` matches either `triangle[3]` or `triangle[2]`:
     - If a match is found, `triangle[5]` is assigned as token 'C'.
     - Otherwise, `triangle[4]` is assigned as token 'C'.

4. **Create Ordered Token List:**
   - The function constructs a list (`tokens`) that represents the ordered sequence of tokens in the triangular arbitrage 
     transaction. The sequence is arranged as [A, B, C, A], ensuring that the trade begins and ends with token 'A'.

5. **Return Ordered Token List:**
   - The function returns the `tokens` list, which will then be used in further calculations and to execute the triangular 
     arbitrage transaction.

### Parameters:
- `triangle`: A list or array representing the tokens involved in the triangular arbitrage opportunity. The tokens in the 
  `triangle` array are not initially ordered and need to be arranged according to the sequence of trades.

### Returns:
- A list (`tokens`) containing the ordered sequence of tokens [A, B, C, A], where:
  - `A` is the token used as both the input and output in the arbitrage transaction.
  - `B` and `C` are the intermediate tokens involved in the triangular trade.

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Token Ordering:** The function intelligently identifies and orders the tokens involved in a triangular 
  arbitrage trade, ensuring the correct sequence is followed for profit calculation and transaction execution.
- **Versatile Token Handling:** The function can handle different triangular configurations by determining the correct 
  sequence based on token relationships within the `triangle` array.
- **Output Consistency:** The function guarantees that the output list starts and ends with the same token, which is a 
  critical requirement for triangular arbitrage strategies.
